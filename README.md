# Japanese Speech Recognition PowerPoint Plugin
This plugin for Microsoft PowerPoint utilizes Azure Cognitive Services' Speech Recognition Module to transcribe spoken Japanese into text, displaying the results directly onto presentation slides. This plugin also parses Japanese text and inserts line breaks to enhance subtitle readability.

#### Prerequisites
To use this plugin, ensure that you have installed [CaboCha](https://taku910.github.io/cabocha/) and configured it correctly in your system environment. CaboCha should be accessible from your command prompt. You will also need to have a working version of Microsoft PowerPoint.

#### Running the plugin
To get started, open the `*2021_nicholas/system/visualstudio/PowerPointAddIn1.sln*` file in Visual Studio and build the Solution. If you're interested in testing just the Japanese parser, navigate to the ParsingTest1 directory, open the .sln file, and build the Solution there.

#### Demonstration
Watch the plugin in action.
